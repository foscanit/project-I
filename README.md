# project-I-Pandas

# Overview

This aim of this project is to clean and format a dataset containing information about shark attacks, and use the data to produce visualizations that will either  prove or disprove my hypotheses.
<br>

# Requirements/Libraries Used:
This code was written in Python/Jupyter Notebook, using the following libraries:
<br>
- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
<br>
 

# Hypotheses:
<br>

## 1- Most of the people that provoke shark attacks nowadays are men (between years 2000-2018).
## 2- Young men, between 20 and 30 years old, are usually the ones who provoke shark attacks.
## 3- Men that provoke shark attacks are usually from first world countries. 
## 4- Most of the people that provoke shark attacks are divers.

# Most of the people that provoke shark attacks nowadays are men (between years 2000-2018):

In this first inquiry, we recieved conclusive results, men are 90% more likely to provoke shark attacks.

# Young men, between 20 and 30 years old, are usually the ones who provoke shark attacks.

This inquiry was also conclusive, people tend to provoke shark attacks between their early and late twenties.

# Men that provoke shark attacks are usually from first world countries. 

This was my intitial thought and I wasn't wrong because according to the research most of the provoked shark attacks occur in Florida.

# Most of the people that provoke shark attacks are divers. 

But in this hypothesis I was wrong, because the activity that most of people who provoke shark attacks are performing is fishing! However, we could say it's recreational fishing, instead of a professional activity.

# In Conclusion
- Men are more likely to provoke shark attacks, specially during their 20s.
- Nowadays, most of the people that provoke shark attacks are from Florida, United States.
- Furthermore, we could say that they provoke these attacks while they are fun fishing. In fact, most of these people recorded -their attack while they were “Shark fishing”, “Fishing for Sharks”, “Fishing illegally”, “Fishing tag and release”, “Surf fishing” “Free diving and spearfishing” and “Kayak fishing for sharks”.
